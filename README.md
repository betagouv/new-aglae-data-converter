# New AGLAE Data Converter

This project is a tool to convert data files from the New AGLAE particle accelerator to HDF5 format. The tool supports the conversion of imagery analysis data in LST format and spectrum/standards data for punctual analysis. The tool consists of a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) written with Qt.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- The following Python packages:
  - h5py
  - numpy
  - pyside6

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/new-aglae-data-converter.git
   ```
2. cd new-aglae-data-converter

   ```
   cd new-aglae-data-converter
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### GUI

To use the GUI, run the following command:

```
python gui.py
```

Follow the prompts in the GUI to select the source and destination folders and start the conversion process.

### CLI

To use the CLI, run the following command:

```
python converter.py /path/to/source/folder /path/to/destination/folder
```

Replace /path/to/source/folder and /path/to/destination/folder with the actual paths to the source and destination folders on your machine.

## Development

### CI

Opening or editing a pull request will trigger a [GitHub action](.github/workflows/test-converter.yml). It downloads a zip file containing test data and HDF5 files that were generated by the latest version of the converter from an Azure Blob Storage bucket. The updated code is then run to produce new HDF5 files, which are compared to the saved ones using [h5diff](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/HDF5/h5diff). If there are any differences between the old and new HDF5 files, the CI will fail. If your pull request modifies the structure of the HDF5 files, you must upload a new zip file to the storage bucket to update the HDF5 files that are used to run these tests.

## Packaging

To package the project for sharing, you can use the tool [nuitka](https://nuitka.net/). For example, to package the GUI, you can run the following command:

```
nuitka --onefile --plugin-enable=pyside6 --plugin-enable=numpy --clang ./main.py
```

On Windows this will create a single excutable file that you can share with others.
